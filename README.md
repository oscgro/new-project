# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is about AI based software in recruitment. Since many companies often have many jobb applications per day an AI based recruiter would help them be more effective.


## Background

The problems it solves is that HR at a company doesn't have to spend too much time reading through all applications where it would be sorted by AI instead. It has been a problem that some does not even get an interview even if they are totally qualified for a job they have applied to. This system would fix it to be a more fair system.

* Faster replys from companies
* A more fair system


## How is it used?
The process of using this solution is that all applications that the system recieves are stored in a database where the AI then scans for matches based on keywords and potential.




## Data sources and AI methods
The data comes from the applications and the wanted variables from the applicants.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?
The project could grow by starting a company that sells this recruitment solution to other companies and hopefully be a tool most companies would use.
The skills needed would firstly be to make the product and code it then make the company and start selling.
